# YourControls_IRIS_PC21

# Made for MSFS2020 and not validated for 2024

* Profile to work with YourControls application and MSFS2020. If you find any bugs, please contact me on YourControls Discord: Dkgolfnut_Dennis

# Version 0.3

# KNOWN ISSUES:
   -  Buttons o the LEFT MDFD (LMFD) and RIGHT MFD (RMFD)have 2 stages of engagement. I have found slow long click transitions the options fine. Fast clicks may not sync between PIC and the Second pilots plane

# FIXES:
   -2/3/2025 removed conflicting WT definitions whihc allowed the Normal Autopilot definitions profile to work
   -1/29/2025 Stripped out AP logic and implemented stanard AP definition  plus 2 LVARS from, PC12 due to feedback from Angel
   - Initial release 10/28/2024 to testing group

I recommend that you and your co-pilot first conduct a test flight to check if everything is working properly.
